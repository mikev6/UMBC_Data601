# Working with Timeseries

Next week, we will be discussing how to work with time series data. Before the class please make sure you take a look at the following material:

[Python Data Science Handbook - Working with Timeseries](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.11-working-with-time-series.html)

I found these youtube videos are also particularly useful but these are optional:
